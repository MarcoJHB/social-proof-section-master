## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was a real tough one! It looked easy in the beginning, so I decided to try a mobile-first approach. This meant doing all the mobile layouts first. However, the desktop version had a unique layout, and I didn't think of seeing how a simple version that would allow less css to be used.

I learned here to really focus on mobile-desktop transition, and if there's an easier way of coding.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:



### Continued development

I'd eventually like to rewrite my code in a cleaner fashion, and maybe add some css/js animations.
